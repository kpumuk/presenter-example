= Rspec Cells

This plugin allows you to test your cells easily using RSpec.
Basically, it adds an example group especially for cells, with
several helpers to perform cells rendering.

If you are not sure what is cells, please visit its home page:

http://cells.rubyforge.org/

= Installation

If you’re using Rails 2.1, you can simply use "script/plugin".
It will export all the code from GitHub into "vendor/plugins":

  script/plugin install git://github.com/kpumuk/rspec-cells.git

If you are using Rails prior to 2.1, use the following:

  cd vendor/plugins
  git clone git://github.com/kpumuk/rspec-cells.git
  rm -rf rspec-cells/.git
  cd ../..

To continuously track meta-tags development, it’s probably best
to install it as a plugin using some vendor branch management tool
like Braid:

  gem install evilchelu-braid

Using Braid to add a Rails plugin is simple:

  # (make sure you've committed everything first)
  braid add -p git://github.com/kpumuk/rspec-cells.git

  # now you should have the library in vendor/plugins/rspec-cells

After that is done, add following line into your <tt>spec_helper.rb</tt>:

  require 'spec/cells'

= Usage

Put all your cells specs under <tt>spec/cells</tt> folder. Here is how
spec looks like in general:

  describe VideoCell do
    integrate_views
  
    context '.videos' do
      it 'should initialize :videos variable' do
        params[:id] = 10
        session[:user_id] = 20
        opts[:opt] = 'value'
        result = render_cell :videos, { :videos => [] }, :slug => 'hello'
        result.should have_tag('div', :class => :videos)
      end
    end
  end

Please note: when you don't pass a cell to describe, like this:

  describe ThingsCell do

then you must provide a <tt>cell_name</tt> within the context of
your cell specs:

  describe "ThingCell" do
    cell_name :thing

In your spec you can use <tt>render_cell</tt> method to perform cell
rendering.

By default rendering will not be performed, only code from cell class
will be called. To do rendering, add <tt>integrate_views!</tt>
statement in your <tt>describe</tt> block (just like you do for
controllers).

From your spec you have access to several variables:

* <tt>opts</tt> — options being passed to cell.
* <tt>params</tt> — request parameters.
* <tt>session</tt> — current session.
* <tt>request</tt> — request object.
* <tt>assigns</tt> — an array of cell instance variables.
